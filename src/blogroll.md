# Blogroll

There's a lot of good websites out there. These are a few I have found that I want to share with you and share with my future self.

I keep finding sites I want to add, so to give every entry their time in the limelight, they're ordered from most to least recent.

<style>
  h2 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
  }

  section {
    background-color: var(--foreground-color);
    border: 0.25rem solid var(--border-color);
    border-radius: 1rem;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px var(--border-color);
    padding: 1rem;
  }

  section + section {
    margin-block-start: 1rem;
  }

  section * {
    margin: 0;
  }
</style>
