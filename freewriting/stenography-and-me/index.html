<h1>Freewriting #2: Stenography and me</h1>
<p><em>July 28, 2024</em></p>
<p>Back in August 2022, I came upon the concept of “stenography” for the first time. Basically - and I'm likely butchering the real meaning here - it's the art of writing really quickly using shorthand writing systems. Well, if “shorthand” also includes writing on those specialized keyboards that court recorders use.</p>
<p>(This is what you get when you make me keep writing forwards without looking anything up.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that stenographers reach writing speeds of 240+ words per minute, all while using a really ergonomic, movement-efficient machine so they only make a few movements per second. It is a completely different beast to writing on keyboard, hammering away to reach just a fraction of the WPM.</p>
<p>I was utterly fascinated. I dived into the topic and found out there is hobbyist software and hobbyist keyboards for doing stenography, that there are a variety of “theories” for deciding which key combinations corresponded to which words (my theory of choice was “Lapwing”), sites for practicing the fundamentals, and an active community Discord server.</p>
<p>I forced myself to wait a few days to see if the rush of excitement of “shiny new hobby” would wear off. Then I shelled out about $200 for a Nolltronics stenography keyboard and had it shipped to Norway, under the internal justification of “career expense.” After all, if I learned to write really fast, that's worth a lot more than $200, right?</p>
<p>The first thing that happened when it arrived was I had a lot of fun. I'm the kind of person who enjoys learning languages and learning weird things. Stenography theories are like weird languages, so naturally, I was having a blast.</p>
<p>I’m also the kind of person who has no problem doing practice drills, and a lot of learning stenography is practicing the mechanical movements. I enjoyed doing single key stroke drills, double key stroke drills, both-hand drills, doing them over and over then shaking it up, watching myself slowly speeding up and doing it smoother, as if I was practicing guitar.</p>
<p>It didn't take many days before I was trying to use stenography for everyday tasks, like messaging friends. It was super awkward at first, like I was stumbling my way through saying “where is the bathroom” in a foreign language, except much slower and with more dictionary lookups. But it was so much fun. After a couple of weeks, I was able to write certain common words and sentences really smoothly, and it felt good.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks, my RSI also came back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>I had to abandon stenography and conserve my tendons. The keyboard is still packed away in its case, on a bookshelf in my home, waiting for me to pick it up again or to find it a better home.</p>
<p>There's a common saying in programming that typing speed is never the bottleneck when you write software. And in this case, I managed to hurt a whole different bottleneck in my quest to type faster.</p>
<p>Still, I do not regret the attempt.</p>
