A couple of days ago a friend shared the post ["You (And I) Can Do Hard Things" by Jarrod Blundy](https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/8/you-and-i-can-do-hard-things). It placed the phrase "you can do hard things" squarely into my mind where it has been bouncing around since.

This morning I read ["Learning and Hacking" by Alan Page](https://angryweasel.substack.com/p/learning-and-hacking), which includes a copy of the essay "Always Put Yourself On The Steepest Learning Curve." And now that's bouncing around in my mind too.

Add a shot of recent personal events, shake vigorously, and now I am **losing my mind**.

This week I crashed headfirst into what I'm being forced to call "burnout," and I've realized that part of what brought it on is being persistently under-challenged. I haven't been doing "hard things" at my job for... hell, over a year now? And it's been grating on me to the point where, now, my soul cannot take it anymore?

And now Chance has it to put phrases like "you can do hard things" and "put yourself on the steepest learning curve" into my head this weekend and now I have too many things on my mind and I have to reconsider my entire work situation.
