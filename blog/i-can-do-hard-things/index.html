    <h1>I can do hard things</h1>
    <i>August 11, 2024</i>
    <p>A couple of days ago a friend shared the post <a href="https://heydingus.net/blog/2024/8/you-and-i-can-do-hard-things">&quot;You (And I) Can Do Hard Things&quot; by Jarrod Blundy</a>. It placed the phrase &quot;you can do hard things&quot; squarely into my mind where it has been bouncing around since.</p>
<p>This morning I read <a href="https://angryweasel.substack.com/p/learning-and-hacking">&quot;Learning and Hacking&quot; by Alan Page</a>, which includes a copy of the essay &quot;Always Put Yourself On The Steepest Learning Curve.&quot; And now that's bouncing around in my mind too.</p>
<p>Add a shot of recent personal events, shake vigorously, and now I am <strong>losing my mind</strong>.</p>
<p>This week I crashed headfirst into what I'm being forced to call &quot;burnout,&quot; and I've realized that part of what brought it on is being persistently under-challenged. I haven't been doing &quot;hard things&quot; at my job for... hell, over a year now? And it's been grating on me to the point where, now, my soul cannot take it anymore?</p>
<p>And now Chance has it to put phrases like &quot;you can do hard things&quot; and &quot;put yourself on the steepest learning curve&quot; into my head this weekend and now I have too many things on my mind and I have to reconsider my entire work situation.</p>
