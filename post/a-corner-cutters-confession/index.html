I know I should have done this one better.</p><p>Yes, I didn&rsquo;t spend time improving the design before I went to work. I slotted my change right into the design that was already there. It fit okay! With some slight cruft, duplication, and clunky call chaining, but still! Don&rsquo;t look at me like that - even Kent Beck says &ldquo;making the change easy&rdquo; is the hard part, and my job is hard enough!</p><p>And yes, yes, I didn&rsquo;t write any tests first. I know it would have made my work easier, and refactoring less error-prone. And it would have helped me out in the design process. But I knew what I needed to do (mostly)! And I could just boot up the app and test it manually - it was familiar and convenient!</p><p>What&rsquo;s that? Did I write any tests after, then? Oh, no, I didn&rsquo;t do that either. I&rsquo;d, uh, already tested all the use cases manually by the time I finished. It felt like a waste of time not to merge the work and move on. Yes, I have no cheap way of catching regressions now, I know, I know. Can we move on?</p><p>Because there&rsquo;s so much to move on to. I can&rsquo;t afford to feel like I&rsquo;m slow. There&rsquo;s so many more things to do! Important things! Features! Stories! Bugs! <em>Pull requests!</em> The board is so long and the days are so short and <em>I need to do my part</em>.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>I just&mldr; I know it&rsquo;s better to move slowly and deliberately. I know it&rsquo;s a matter of practice. And I know it relieves stress in the end.</p><p>But there&rsquo;s just so much code, so many loose threads, and so much work to do. I can only bear so much of it in my head.</p><p>Can you fault me for going along with the flow?</p></article></main><footer><div class=footer-links><a rel=me href=https://hachyderm.io/@cvennevik title=Mastodon>Mastodon</a>
