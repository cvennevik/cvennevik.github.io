    <h1>Slay the Spire #4: Links are real, and strong, and they are my friend</h1>
    <i>August 3, 2024</i>
    <p>The thing about doing a project as daily writing-and-coding sessions is you get a lot of time inbetween sessions to mull things over. Two things have been stuck in my mind since last time:</p>
<ol>
<li>My unease with the navigation issue, overriding and re-implementing link behavior.</li>
<li>How to dynamically render the HTML based on game state.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a good idea for that second issue now, but I just returned from holiday, and lack the time and energy to finish it today. Ideally, I'd like to get a bit of coding done in each post I do, but if I leave this post in the pipes for a third day in a row, I'm going to feel constipated.</p>
<p>Today, we're only talking navigation.</p>
<hr>
<p>To recap the navigation issue: I concluded that we want to navigate between game states, as if they were pages, and that links are the most appropriate UI control for that. I also concluded that <em>we will have too much state to keep all the data in URLs</em>, meaning we have to override normal link behavior and re-implement it all to work with our application state.</p>
<p>I was aware, at the time, that it would be messy and difficult to do right. Having sat with it for a day, it now looks <em>even worse</em> in my mind.</p>
<p>When pages have state stored outside the URL, and links modify that state instead of navigating to a URL, here are all the affordances I can think of that we lose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page history</li>
<li>Navigating to the next/previous page</li>
<li>Opening links in a new tab</li>
<li>Reloading pages without losing data</li>
<li>Browser bookmarks</li>
<li>Sharing page links with others</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of those items sound like a pain to re-implement to the standard of normal links. The rest of them sound <em>impossible</em> to re-implement to the same standard.</p>
<p>These affordances are <em>useful</em> and <em>expected</em>. Messing them up would make our app <em>kind of crap</em>. I don't want to make this project kind of crap, I want to make it <em>nice</em>. Messing with link behavior would make a mess that we cannot clean up.</p>
<p>However. I was struck with an idea. I think it <em>is</em> possible to fit all the necessary page state in less than a couple thousand characters. And if we accomplish that, the constraint that pushed us down this dark path in the first place is gone.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p><strong>Plain links are back on menu!</strong></p>
