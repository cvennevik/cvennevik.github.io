    <h1>Slay the Spire #6: Let&#39;s go to Codeberg!</h1>
    <i>August 11, 2024</i>
    <p>It's been a week since the last post of this series now, so I can definitely say that the pace of this series is slowing down after the end-of-holiday rush.</p>
<p>I've been thinking, for this project, that I want to make things fit into little steps, little sessions. If all I have is a little less than an hour, then I want to be able to fit writing a post and making some progress into that little hour. I have a few minutes to spare this evening, so let's see if we can put something out this week and give this thing a little heartbeat.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think it's time we set up version control for this. I want to have the file backed up somewhere else, I want to have a version history I can look back through, and I want to be able to link to specific snapshots of the code in these posts. No time better than now to get that set up.</p>
<p>Currently I host all my code on GitHub. I've thought about moving to a different host for anti-GitHub-Microsoft-monopoly reasons, but...</p>
<p>I was going to say I don't have time to set it up elsewhere right now, but do I know that's true? Let's set this project up on another Git hosting service I've been vaguely aware of: <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a>. It's a &quot;democratic, community-driven non-profit.&quot; Sounds neat!</p>
<h2>Step 1: Create account</h2>
<ul>
<li>Took me a couple of minutes, mostly waiting for the &quot;confirm your account&quot; email to show up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Go to settings and set up the SSH keys I expect I'll need</h2>
<ul>
<li>Oh hey I can set my pronouns for my profile here! Neat.</li>
<li>I already have an SSH public/private key pair set up locally, so probably I can just add my public key to Codeberg...?</li>
<li>Yup! Looks like it worked.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Create a repository for our project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gah, I already have a project named &quot;slay-the-spire-solver&quot; from my 2022 go at this. And naming it generically would be <em>boring</em>.</li>
<li>I think... I can make a swing for it an pick a name for the project now. What about...</li>
<li><strong>Crystal Spire?</strong></li>
<li>It's <em>just</em> unique enough (searching for it online gives me results for a World of Warcraft quest/item, I'm fine colliding with that), and crystal is a sort of material you can see through, but can also split light many, many ways? Sort of like we want to look through battles throughout the Spire?</li>
<li>That's it, I'm committing to it. <a href="https://codeberg.org/cvennevik/crystal-spire">cvennevik/crystal-spire</a> created. Description: &quot;A tool for analyzing combat encounters in Slay the Spire.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 4: Initialize the repository with our code</h2>
<ul>
<li>Okay so I want to do something here that will make this step harder. I want to create commits, retroactively, for the state of the code after each of the blog posts that I've written so far. I think it would be fun to follow the evolution of the project step by step like that.</li>
<li>I'll create a fresh &quot;crystal-spire&quot; directory on my computer and initialize the Git repository there.</li>
<li>Then, following my old blog posts, copying and pasting, let's see what we get...
<ul>
<li>First post. Create an initial index.html. <a href="https://codeberg.org/cvennevik/crystal-spire/commit/13ea21e15f66564b20ea0972187ce772c4437653">Commit: <em>&quot;#1: HTML first&quot;</em></a>.</li>
<li>Second post. <a href="https://codeberg.org/cvennevik/crystal-spire/commit/2fb0c59bcc6ab0799d350b69c9859b1059b7d95d">Commit: <em>&quot;#2: Actions and consequences&quot;</em></a>.</li>
<li>Third post. <a href="https://codeberg.org/cvennevik/crystal-spire/commit/12d6098e07ecd5de448b3d76e96805c9496145bb">Commit: <em>&quot;#3: Introducing links&quot;</em></a>.</li>
<li>Fourth post has no code changes.</li>
<li>Fifth post. Phew, here I can just copy and paste my latest version. <a href="https://codeberg.org/cvennevik/crystal-spire/commit/f6b46cd46502af1e872869ac2c8f6de71cfaa657">Commit: <em>&quot;#5: Going dynamic&quot;</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And... that's it. The project is now version controlled. This is very comforting to me, as I like to use Git to keep track of current changes, and I commit frequently. When something's broken or half-done, it's stressful to me to have a lot of code in the air. I like being able to scrap everything I've done and return to a last known healthy point. Especially for a project like this that I want to make friendly to my short attention spans.</p>
<p>I'm going to go back and put links to these in all the previous posts. Ideally, I'd also want a link to the live version of the code at each version, so you can check it out and play around, but that looks non-trivial. Another time, maybe.</p>
<p>Now. One extra commit. To make the naming consistent.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;title&gt;Crystal Spire&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1&gt;Crystal Spire&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Commit: &quot;Rename to Crystal Spire&quot;.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
