                <p>A few months ago I wrote <a href="https://www.cvennevik.no/blog/code-reviews-are-overloaded/">a post</a> suggesting that you should limit your pull request reviews to their bare essentials, the &quot;bare essentials&quot; here meaning &quot;bugs and irreversible design decisions.&quot; I've had the chance to try doing this at work, and now I can share my findings with you:</p>
<p>Boy howdy, I do not enjoy this at all.</p>

                <p>We throw around the &quot;technical debt&quot; metaphor a lot in software development. On project after project, we experience the system becoming harder to change as we work on it. Rushed design decisions come back to bite us in the butt. Progress slows to a crawl. We say we have accrued a lot of &quot;technical debt.&quot;</p>
